# Pomodoro Mobile Application

The goal of this project is to increase my knowledge of React Native and mobile design/engineer. Pomodoro is a time management technique that utilizes breaks and "sprints" for better workflow. I decided to make a "Pomodoro" application to one day create an user ready mobile app for the market. Design and development is done solely by me.

With my background in react.js, this project was my first real attempt at an react native mobile application. I learned how states works within react native.
